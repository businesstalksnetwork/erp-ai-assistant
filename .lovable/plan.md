## Progress Summary

The payroll module is now well-rounded:
- Payroll calculation with payment type multipliers
- Payroll analytics (benchmark page with KPIs, charts, category breakdowns)
- HR Reports payroll tab (per-employee monthly breakdown)
- Dashboard payroll cost widget

## Recommended Next Steps

Here are the logical next areas to tackle:

1. **Settings navigation cleanup** — Add payroll parameters, payment types, and categories links to the Settings hub so admins can find them without memorizing routes.

2. **Work logs payment type UI** — Add a payment type selector to the Work Logs entry form so users can tag hours with the correct multiplier type (overtime, night, holiday, etc.).

3. **Payroll run detail page** — Create a dedicated page to view a completed payroll run with per-employee line items, totals, and export/PDF options.

4. **Other module** — Switch focus to a different area (CRM, Production, Inventory, POS, etc.).
